# ðŸ§ª Lab 4 â€“ Virtualization & Linux Fundamentals (using existing Ubuntu Server VM)

**Estimated Duration:** 3 hours  
**Instructions:** Complete all practical tasks in a repository named `Lab4`. When finished, push your work to a repository named `CC_<student_Name>_<student_roll_number>`.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
This lab guides handsâ€‘on virtualization and core Linux fundamentals. You will work with the Ubuntu Server VM already installed in VMware Workstation (no new OS install required), inspect virtualization settings, explore the Linux filesystem, perform essential command-line tasks, collect system information, and manage users.

By the end of this lab you will be able to:
- Inspect a VM's resources and networking settings in VMware Workstation  
- Explore the Linux filesystem hierarchy and hidden (dot) files  
- Use basic Linux CLI commands to navigate and manipulate files and directories  
- Read system information (kernel, CPU, memory, disk) and list processes  
- Create a nonâ€‘root user and verify its account existence  
- Create and run a small shell script (Bonus)

---

## ðŸ§© Prerequisites
- You already have an Ubuntu Server VM installed in VMware Workstation from Lab 1 â€” use that VM for all tasks in this lab.  
- Host machine: Windows (preferred for Task 2) / macOS / Linux with VMware Workstation available.  
- SSH access to the VM from your host (Command Prompt / PowerShell / Terminal) â€” you will use the host's terminal to connect.  
- A text editor inside VM (nano, vim, or other).  
- Note: This course has not covered pipes (`|`) or redirection (`>`, `>>`), and you should not use them for this lab.

## Task 1 â€“ Verify VM resources in VMware

Confirm the VM resources that were allocated in Lab 1.

### Steps
1. Open VMware Workstation and locate the Ubuntu Server VM you used in Lab 1.  
2. Inspect VM settings and note the following (no commands required for GUI): VM name, RAM, CPU, disk, and network adapter type.  
3. Take a screenshot of the VM settings window showing RAM, CPU, disk and networking. Save screenshot as: `vm_settings.png`

ðŸ“¸ Screenshot Required:
- `vm_settings.png`

---

## Task 2 â€“ Start VM and log in (use your preferred host terminal method only)

Use a single preferred host-terminal method to connect to the VM. Do not switch between methods during the task.

### Steps
1. Start (or resume) the VM in VMware Workstation on your host.  
2. From your host, open your preferred terminal (for example: Windows Command Prompt, PowerShell, macOS Terminal, or Linux Terminal) and connect to the VM using SSH. Example:

```bash
ssh student@<vm-ip-address>
```

- After connecting, save a screenshot of your host terminal showing the SSH login prompt/results as: `vm_login.png`

3. After logging in, run both commands and capture them together in a single screenshot:

```bash
whoami
pwd
```

- Save a single screenshot that clearly shows both outputs as: `whoami_pwd.png`

ðŸ“¸ Screenshot Required:
- `vm_login.png` (optional if `whoami_pwd.png` provided)  
- `whoami_pwd.png` (required; must show both `whoami` and `pwd` outputs)

---

## Task 3 â€“ Filesystem exploration â€” root tree and dotfiles

Explore Linux filesystem layout and hidden files. Capture outputs using screenshots only (do not create text files). For the short explanation required in this task, write the paragraph in an editor and capture it as a screenshot (`answers_md.png`) â€” do not supply the `.md` file.

### Steps (run inside VM terminal)
1. List root directory contents:

```bash
ls -la /
```

- Save screenshot as: `ls_root.png`

2. View OS release information:

```bash
cat /etc/os-release
```

- Save screenshot as: `os_release.png`

3. Inspect these directories (run each command and screenshot the output):

```bash
ls -la /bin
```
- Save screenshot as `ls_bin.png`.

```bash
ls -la /sbin
```
- Save screenshot as `ls_sbin.png`.

```bash
ls -la /usr
```
- Save screenshot as `ls_usr.png`.

```bash
ls -la /opt
```
- Save screenshot as `ls_opt.png`.

```bash
ls -la /etc
```
- Save screenshot as `ls_etc.png`.

```bash
ls -la /dev
```
- Save screenshot as `ls_dev.png`.

```bash
ls -la /var
```
- Save screenshot as `ls_var.png`.

```bash
ls -la /tmp
```
- Save screenshot as `ls_tmp.png`.

4. List your home directory and show hidden (dot) files:

```bash
ls -la ~
```

- Save screenshot as: `home_ls.png`

5. Write a short paragraph (3â€“5 sentences) that explains the difference between `/bin`, `/usr/bin` and `/usr/local/bin`. Open your editor:

```bash
nano ~/answers.md
```

- Type the paragraph in the editor, save and exit.  
- After saving, open the editor display (or show the file) and capture a screenshot of the paragraph. Save that screenshot as: `answers_md.png`

> Reminder: Do not upload the `.md` fileâ€”submit the screenshot `answers_md.png` as proof of your written answer.

ðŸ“¸ Screenshot Required:
- `ls_root.png`  
- `os_release.png`  
- `ls_bin.png`  
- `ls_sbin.png`  
- `ls_usr.png`  
- `ls_opt.png`  
- `ls_etc.png`  
- `ls_dev.png`  
- `ls_var.png`  
- `ls_tmp.png`  
- `home_ls.png`  
- `answers_md.png`

4. (Optional) From the new user you may attempt a sudo command to show that sudo is not available for this account (expected failure), e.g.:

```bash
sudo whoami
```

### Steps (inside VM)
1. Open an editor to create the script:

```bash
nano ~/lab4/workspace/run-demo.sh
```
- Type the following lines into the editor (manually or paste), save and exit:

```
#!/bin/bash
echo "Lab 4 demo: current user is $(whoami)"
echo "Current time: $(date)"
uptime
free -h
```

**Notes & Tips**
- Use screenshots to capture command outputs and written answers since we are not using redirection or pipes in this course.  
- Save your short written answers in an editor (e.g., nano) and capture them as `answers_md.png`. Do not submit the `.md` fileâ€”submit the screenshot only.  
- If you need to copy terminal output into a file, open an editor (nano/vim), paste the text, and save the file. Do not use `>` redirection for this course.  
- Take snapshots before risky changes in VMware Workstation.

---

## Submission (format)
- ZIP the repository (or push to GitHub) and submit link or ZIP file per instructor guidelines. Include both PDF and Markdown or a Word export of your answers if required.

Good luck â€” when you finish, provide your repository link here and I will run a quick checklist to verify required files exist.
