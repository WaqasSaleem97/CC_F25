# 🧪 Lab 5 – Java, apt vs apt-get, snap, GUI, Vim on Ubuntu Server

**Estimated Duration:** 3 hours  
**Instructions:** Complete all practical tasks in a repository named `Lab5`. When finished, push your work to a repository named `CC_<student_Name>_<student_roll_number>`.

---

## 🎯 Objective
This lab demonstrates package discovery and management on an Ubuntu Server (CLI) and installing/configuring a lightweight GUI for remote access. You will:
- Discover how the system suggests packages when a command is not installed (example: java).  
- Install and remove Java using both apt and apt-get.  
- Learn the difference between apt update and apt upgrade.  
- Install an application with snap on a headless server and verify installation.  
- Install and configure a lightweight GUI (XFCE) and XRDP for remote desktop access, and control GUI login behavior at boot.
- Launch and visually verify Visual Studio Code in the GUI (Task 5 & Task 6).
- Add a third‑party apt repository and signing key to install Google Chrome (Task 7).
- Add PPAs and install GUI apps (Task 8).
- Create a simple Kubernetes Pod manifest using vim (Task 9).
- Edit the Kubernetes manifest to add an annotation and practice discarding edits (Task 10).
- Practice basic vim editing commands (Task 11).
- Practice vim search, navigation, substitution and undo (Task 12).

By the end of this lab you will be able to:
- Follow the package suggestion workflow when a command is missing.  
- Install and remove packages with apt and apt-get, and clear terminal command caches.  
- Distinguish apt update from apt upgrade.  
- Install snap packages on a headless server and verify installation.  
- Install and configure XFCE + XRDP and control whether the system boots to GUI or CLI.  
- Start the GUI, launch VS Code (installed earlier), visually confirm it opens.  
- Add third‑party apt sources and keys to install Google Chrome and other apps via PPA.  
- Use vim to create and save a Kubernetes sample YAML file and practice adding annotations, discarding edits, and basic navigation/undo operations.  
- Use vim search, navigate matches, add matches, perform substitutions, and undo changes.

---

## 🧩 Prerequisites
- An Ubuntu Server VM (the same VM used in Lab 4 is fine).  
- SSH access to the VM from your host terminal.  
- Sudo privileges on the VM.  
- Note: Installing a GUI and third‑party packages increases disk and memory usage. Ensure the VM has sufficient resources.

## Task 1 - Discover missing command & install Java using apt suggestion

Goal: Run the `java` command when it's not installed, follow the system suggestion to install a Java package using apt, verify, then remove and clear shell cache.

### Steps (inside the VM terminal)

1. Run the `java` command to see what the system suggests:

```bash
java
```

- Expected: message similar to "The program 'java' can be found in the following packages: ... Try: sudo apt install <package-name>"
- Save screenshot as: `task1_java_suggestion.png`

2. Use the suggested apt command (copy the exact package name suggested by the system). Example (replace <suggested-package> with the name shown on your VM):

```bash
sudo apt install <suggested-package> -y
```

- Save screenshot of the apt install progress (or final lines) as: `task1_java_install.png`

3. Verify Java is installed and check version:

```bash
java --version
```

- Save screenshot as: `task1_java_version.png`

4. Remove the Java package using apt remove (use the same package name you installed):

```bash
sudo apt remove <suggested-package> -y
```

- Save screenshot as: `task1_java_remove.png`

5. Confirm `java` is no longer available (run `java` again) — it should again indicate "not found" or suggest installation:

```bash
java
```

- Save screenshot as: `task1_java_not_found.png`

6. Clear the shell's command hash cache so the shell forgets cached command locations (run as your regular user — no sudo required):

```bash
hash -r
java
```

- Save screenshot showing `hash -r` followed by `java` result as: `task1_hash_clear.png`

📸 Screenshot Required:
- `task1_java_suggestion.png`  
- `task1_java_install.png`  
- `task1_java_version.png`  
- `task1_java_remove.png`  
- `task1_java_not_found.png`  
- `task1_hash_clear.png`

Notes:
- Use the exact package the VM suggests. Typical suggestions include `default-jre`, `openjdk-11-jre-headless`, or similar.

---

## Task 2 - Install & remove Java using apt-get (explicitly)

Goal: Repeat install/remove using the apt-get tool to show both package managers.

### Steps (inside VM terminal)

1. Install Java using apt-get (choose a common package, e.g., default-jre — or the same package you used in Task 1):

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install default-jre -y
```

- Save screenshot(s) as: `task2_aptget_install.png`

2. Verify Java version again:

```bash
java --version
```

- Save screenshot as: `task2_java_version_after_aptget.png`

3. Remove Java using apt-get remove:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove default-jre -y
```

- Save screenshot as: `task2_aptget_remove.png`

4. Clear the terminal hash cache and confirm java is missing:

```bash
hash -r
java
```

- Save screenshot as: `task2_hash_after_remove.png`

📸 Screenshot Required:
- `task2_aptget_install.png`  
- `task2_java_version_after_aptget.png`  
- `task2_aptget_remove.png`  
- `task2_hash_after_remove.png`

Notes:
- If you installed a different package in Task 1, use the same package name here to avoid leftover files.

---

## Task 3 - apt update vs apt upgrade - run & explain

Goal: Run the commands and document the difference.

### Steps (inside VM terminal)

1. Update the package index (this downloads the latest lists of available packages):

```bash
sudo apt update
```

- Save screenshot as: `task3_apt_update.png`

2. Upgrade installed packages (this installs available updates for currently installed packages):

```bash
sudo apt upgrade
```

- Save screenshot as: `task3_apt_upgrade.png`

3. Write a short 3–5 sentence explanation describing the difference between `apt update` and `apt upgrade`. Put your text into a small file and capture it as a screenshot (do not upload the text file; provide the screenshot):

```bash
nano ~/apt_update_vs_upgrade.md
# write 3-5 sentences, save and exit
```

- Open the file or show it on screen and save screenshot as: `task3_explanation.png`

📸 Screenshot Required:
- `task3_apt_update.png`  
- `task3_apt_upgrade.png`  
- `task3_explanation.png`

Hint (what to mention):
- `apt update` refreshes the local package index — it does not change installed packages.
- `apt upgrade` looks at the updated index and installs newer versions of already-installed packages.
- Without `apt update`, `apt upgrade` would use outdated package lists and might not find the newest updates.

---

## Task 4 - Install Visual Studio Code via snap on CLI and verify (DO NOT remove Code)

Goal: Install a snap package (example: VS Code) on a CLI-only server and verify installation using commands that work without a GUI. Keep Code installed for later GUI tasks.

### Steps (inside VM terminal)

1. Install VS Code via snap (snap may require sudo):

```bash
sudo snap install --classic code
```

- Save screenshot as: `task4_snap_install.png`

2. Verify snap shows the package is installed:

```bash
snap list code
```

- Save screenshot as: `task4_snap_list.png`

3. Check the installed application's version. On some systems `code --version` is available; also check `snap info`:

```bash
code --version
```

- Save screenshot(s) as: `task4_code_version_or_info.png`

4. If the `code` binary is not in PATH, show where the snap placed it:

```bash
ls -l /snap/bin | grep code
```

- Save screenshot as: `task4_snap_bin_location.png`

5. IMPORTANT: Do NOT remove VS Code at the end of this task — keep it installed. It will be launched later in Task 5 and Task 6.

📸 Screenshot Required:
- `task4_snap_install.png`  
- `task4_snap_list.png`  
- `task4_code_version_or_info.png`  
- `task4_snap_bin_location.png`

Notes:
- The main point is to show that snap installs and can be verified from the CLI even if you cannot start the GUI.

---

## Task 5 - Install XFCE GUI + XRDP - minimal desktop and remote access (GUI) and launch VS Code

Goal: Install a lightweight GUI (XFCE), enable XRDP for remote desktop access, and learn how to control whether the GUI login screen appears at boot. After starting the GUI, launch the VS Code installed in Task 4 to verify GUI app launch. This task is for this lab.

> Warning: Installing a GUI on a server consumes additional disk space and memory. Perform on a VM with sufficient resources.

### Steps (inside VM terminal)

1. Update the server (download package lists and apply upgrades):

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

- Save screenshot as: `task5_update.png`

2. Install XFCE and XFCE goodies (lightweight desktop):

```bash
sudo apt install xfce4 xfce4-goodies -y
```

- Save screenshot as: `task5_xfce_install.png`

3. Install and enable XRDP (Remote Desktop Protocol server):

```bash
sudo apt install xrdp -y
sudo systemctl enable --now xrdp
```

- Save screenshot as: `task5_xrdp_enable.png`

4. Verify XRDP status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status xrdp
```

- Save screenshot as: `task5_xrdp_status.png`

5. Configure XRDP to use XFCE session:

```bash
echo xfce4-session > ~/.xsession
```

- Save screenshot as: `task5_xsession.png`

6. Allow RDP through the firewall (if firewall is in use):

```bash
sudo ufw allow 3389/tcp
sudo ufw reload
```

- Save screenshot as: `task5_ufw.png`

7. From a Windows host or RDP client, connect with Remote Desktop (mstsc) to your server IP and login using your Ubuntu username/password. Capture a screenshot of the remote desktop or the RDP session window (if allowed by your environment) and save it as: `task5_rdp_connect.png`

> If you cannot capture a screenshot from the client, show `ss -ltnp` or `ps` evidence that the session was established and save as an alternative.

8. After you are in the GUI (local console or RDP session), launch Visual Studio Code (installed in Task 4) from the GUI menu or a terminal inside the GUI. Example command from a GUI terminal:

```bash
code 
```

- Save a screenshot of VS Code running in the GUI as: `task5_vscode_launch.png`

- (Optional) From inside VS Code you may open a file or explore the UI — but DO NOT need to create or save files here for Task 5.

9. Fix GUI login screen issues (if lightdm / greeter problems appear)

- Install LightDM and greeter:

```bash
sudo apt install lightdm lightdm-gtk-greeter -y
```

- Save screenshot as: `task5_lightdm_install.png`

- Create LightDM config to use XFCE:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d
echo -e "[Seat:*]\ngreeter-session=lightdm-gtk-greeter\nuser-session=xfce\nautologin-user-timeout=0" | sudo tee /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/99-xfce.conf
```

- Save screenshot as: `task5_lightdm_config.png`

- Clean up problematic session files and permissions:

```bash
sudo rm -f /var/lib/lightdm/.Xauthority
sudo rm -f ~/.Xauthority
sudo rm -rf ~/.cache/sessions
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /home/$USER
```

- Save screenshot as: `task5_lightdm_cleanup.png`

- Restart LightDM:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart lightdm
```

- Save screenshot as: `task5_lightdm_restart.png`

10. Control GUI login at boot — ENABLE first, then DISABLE (observe and understand terminal/GUI behavior after each reboot)

Important: students MUST perform the reboot after each target change to observe the boot-time behavior. The sequence below has been adjusted so you ENABLE the GUI boot target first, reboot and observe GUI, then DISABLE the GUI boot target, reboot and observe the CLI.

- Enable GUI Login Screen (Boot to GUI)
  - Re-enable LightDM and set the graphical target as default:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable lightdm
sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target
```

- Save a screenshot immediately after running the commands as: `task5_gui_enable_boot.png`

- Reboot the VM to observe that it boots to the GUI login screen:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

- After the VM boots, capture a screenshot of the GUI login screen (or remote desktop showing the greeter) and save it as: `task5_after_reboot_gui.png`

- Disable GUI Login Screen (Boot to CLI)
  - Set the default boot target to multi-user (text mode) and disable LightDM so the system boots to the terminal:

```bash
sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target
sudo systemctl disable lightdm
```

- Save a screenshot immediately after running the commands as: `task5_gui_disable_boot.png`

- Reboot the VM to observe that it boots to the terminal (CLI):

```bash
sudo reboot
```

- After the VM boots, capture a screenshot of the login prompt or terminal session showing CLI-only behavior and save it as: `task5_after_reboot_cli.png`

- Start/Stop GUI manually (no reboot)
  - You can start the GUI session without changing the boot target. This is useful if you want to keep the boot target as CLI but run GUI temporarily:
  - Save screenshot(s) showing the start commands and any immediate status output as: `task5_gui_start.png`

```bash
sudo systemctl start lightdm   # start GUI now
```
  - Press `Ctrl + Alt + F3` to switch back to TTY. You can stop the GUI session without changing the boot target. 
```bash
sudo systemctl stop lightdm   # stop GUI now

```

- Save screenshot(s) showing the start/stop commands and any immediate status output as: `task5_gui_stop.png`

📸 Screenshot Required:
- `task5_update.png`  
- `task5_xfce_install.png`  
- `task5_xrdp_enable.png`  
- `task5_xrdp_status.png`  
- `task5_xsession.png`  
- `task5_ufw.png`  
- `task5_rdp_connect.png`  
- `task5_vscode_launch.png`  
- `task5_lightdm_install.png`  
- `task5_lightdm_config.png`

- `task5_lightdm_restart.png`  
- `task5_gui_enable_boot.png`  
- `task5_after_reboot_gui.png`  
- `task5_gui_disable_boot.png`  
- `task5_after_reboot_cli.png`  
- `task5_gui_start.png`
- `task5_gui_stop.png`

## Task 6 - GUI verification - start GUI, open VS Code, take snapshot, then end (GUI)

Goal: Verify the GUI environment by starting the GUI, launching VS Code (installed in Task 4), taking a screenshot of the running VS Code window, closing VS Code, and ending the task. This task is for this lab and the first command is to start the Ubuntu GUI.

> NOTE: Per your instruction, Task 6 does NOT require creating/saving any files in VS Code — only launch, capture, and close.

### Steps (inside the VM terminal / via SSH)

1. Start the GUI (if the system is currently set to CLI or the GUI is not running):

```bash
sudo systemctl start lightdm
```

- Save a screenshot immediately after running the command as: `task6_gui_start_command.png`

2. In the GUI session (local console or RDP) launch Visual Studio Code (installed earlier in Task 4). From a GUI terminal inside the desktop, run:

```bash
code
```

- Save a screenshot of VS Code running in the GUI as: `task6_vscode_launch.png`

3. Close VS Code using the GUI window controls. Task 6 ends here.

📸 Screenshot Required:
- `task6_gui_start_command.png`  
- `task6_vscode_launch.png`

## Task 7 - Install Google Chrome by adding its apt source & key (Chrome)

Goal: Add Google's apt source and signing key so that `sudo apt install google-chrome-stable` succeeds. This task intentionally begins by attempting to install Chrome directly (the install will fail if the repository/key are not yet configured) — capture that failure as evidence, then proceed to add the repository/key and install successfully. Also includes an alternate (preferred) one-line list method.

> IMPORTANT: Third-party repositories require trusted signing keys. Only add keys from official vendor URLs. Some systems require /etc/apt/keyrings to exist — create it if missing with sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings.

### Steps (inside the VM terminal or GUI terminal)

1. (Learning step — first command must be the install attempt)
Attempt to install Google Chrome directly to see the failure when the repo/key are missing:

```bash
sudo apt install google-chrome-stable -y
```

- Expected: this will typically fail with "Unable to locate package google-chrome-stable" or similar because the Google repo/key are not yet configured.
- Save a screenshot of the error output as: `task7_install_chrome_error.png`

2. Inspect apt configuration so you understand why install failed. List the /etc/apt directory:

```bash
ls -la /etc/apt
```

- Save screenshot as: `task7_ls_etc_apt.png`

3. View the main /etc/apt/sources.list:

```bash
cat /etc/apt/sources.list
```

- Save screenshot as: `task7_cat_sources_list.png`

4. List files under /etc/apt/sources.list.d:

```bash
ls -la /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
```

- Save screenshot as: `task7_ls_sources_list_d.png`

5. If there is a file named ubuntu.sources (or similarly named source file), display it to see whether Chrome's repo is present:

```bash
cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu.sources
```

- Save screenshot as: `task7_cat_ubuntu_sources.png`

6. Add Chrome repository metadata to a sources file (method A — using ubuntu.sources). Open or create the file and append the stanza (you can alternatively use the preferred one-line method in step 11):

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu.sources
```

- Append these exact lines at the end of the file:

```
Types: deb
URIs:  http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/
Suites: stable
Components: main
Architectures: amd64
Signed-By: /etc/apt/keyrings/google.gpg
```

- Save the file (Ctrl+O → Enter) and exit (Ctrl+X).  
- Save a screenshot after editing (or show the file contents with cat) as: `task7_edit_ubuntu_sources.png`

7. Ensure the keyrings directory exists and import Google's signing key:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://dl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/google.gpg
```

- Save screenshot as: `task7_add_key.png`

8. Update apt and attempt to install Chrome again (now that repo + key are added):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install google-chrome-stable -y
```

- Save screenshots as: `task7_apt_update.png` and `task7_install_chrome.png`

9. Alternate (preferred, cleaner) method — create a single google-chrome.list entry

10. (Optional cleanup before alternate method) If you added the chrome stanza earlier and want to switch to the preferred method:

```bash
sudo apt remove google-chrome-stable -y
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu.sources   # remove the chrome stanza you added earlier, save and exit
sudo rm -f /etc/apt/keyrings/google.gpg
```

- Save screenshots as: `task7_alternate_remove.png`, `task7_alternate_edit.png`, and `task7_remove_key.png`

11. Create a dedicated one-line list file for Google Chrome (preferred):

```bash
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/google.gpg] http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list > /dev/null
```

- Save screenshot as: `task7_create_google_chrome_list.png`

12. Verify the new file exists:

```bash
ls -la /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
```

- Save screenshot as: `task7_list_sources_after_create.png`

13. Re-add the Google signing key (if removed previously or not present):

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://dl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/google.gpg
```

- Save screenshot as: `task7_add_key_alt.png`

14. Update apt and install Chrome (preferred flow):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install google-chrome-stable -y
```

- Save screenshots as: `task7_apt_update_alt.png` and `task7_install_chrome_alt.png`

📸 Screenshot Required:
- `task7_install_chrome_error.png`  
- `task7_ls_etc_apt.png`  
- `task7_cat_sources_list.png`  
- `task7_ls_sources_list_d.png`  
- `task7_cat_ubuntu_sources.png`

## Task 8 - Install applications via PPA (Audacity & OBS) and launch

Goal: Add PPAs for Audacity and OBS Studio, update apt, install the packages, and launch them (or verify installation) from the CLI/GUI. Capture screenshots for each step.

> NOTE: Performing these steps will add third‑party PPAs to the system. Only add PPAs from trusted sources (these are common community PPAs). If your VM environment restricts PPAs, document any errors.

### Steps (inside the VM terminal or GUI terminal)

1. Add the Audacity PPA, update apt and install audacity:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntuhandbook1/audacity -y
sudo apt update
sudo apt install audacity -y
```

- Save screenshots as:
  - `task8_add_ppa_audacity.png` (output of add-apt-repository)
  - `task8_apt_update_audacity.png` (apt update after adding PPA)
  - `task8_install_audacity.png` (apt install output)

2. Launch Audacity (from GUI or CLI). On a headless server you may not get a GUI window — if you are using the XFCE GUI session, launch from a GUI terminal or run check for binary:

```bash
audacity --version
audacity
```

- Save screenshots as:
  - `task8_audacity_launch.png` (GUI launch screenshot if possible) or `task8_audacity_version.png` (CLI verification)

3. Add the OBS Studio PPA, update apt and install obs-studio:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:obsproject/obs-studio -y
sudo apt update
sudo apt install obs-studio -y
```

- Save screenshots as:
  - `task8_add_ppa_obs.png` (output of add-apt-repository)
  - `task8_apt_update_obs.png` (apt update after adding PPA)
  - `task8_install_obs.png` (apt install output)

4. Launch OBS Studio (from GUI or verify binary presence):

```bash
obs --version
obs
```

- Save screenshots as:
  - `task8_obs_launch.png` (GUI launch screenshot if possible) or `task8_obs_version.png` (CLI verification)

📸 Screenshot Required:
- `task8_add_ppa_audacity.png`  
- `task8_apt_update_audacity.png`  
- `task8_install_audacity.png`  
- `task8_audacity_launch.png` or `task8_audacity_version.png`  
- `task8_add_ppa_obs.png`  
- `task8_apt_update_obs.png`  
- `task8_install_obs.png`  
- `task8_obs_launch.png` or `task8_obs_version.png`

Notes:
- On headless servers the GUI may not open — in that case provide the CLI verification screenshots (which / version output).
- If add-apt-repository is not available, install software-properties-common first:
  - `sudo apt install software-properties-common -y` (capture screenshot as `task8_install_software_properties.png`)

## Task 9 - Create a Kubernetes sample YAML using vim

Goal: Confirm vim availability, create a working directory for Lab5, and use vim to create and save a Kubernetes Pod manifest named `k8s-sample.yaml`.

> NOTE: The first command in Task 9 is to run `vim` to confirm whether vim is installed.

### Steps (inside the VM terminal)

1. Check whether vim is installed by running:

```bash
vim
```

- If vim opens, you will see the vim interface; if not installed you will see a command-not-found error.
- Save a screenshot of the result (either the vim splash screen or the error) as: `task9_vim_check.png`
- If vim is not installed, install it:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install vim -y
```

- Save screenshot of the installation as: `task9_vim_install.png` (only if you installed it).

2. Create the Lab5 working directory in your home and change into it:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Lab5
cd ~/Lab5
```

- Save screenshot showing `mkdir` and `cd` or `pwd` output as: `task9_mkdir_cd.png`

3. Create the Kubernetes sample file using vim:

```bash
vim k8s-sample.yaml
```

- Once vim opens, enable insert mode by pressing `i`, then paste the following YAML exactly:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.19
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
  restartPolicy: Always
```

4. Exit insert mode by pressing `Esc`, then save and quit vim with:

```text

## Task 10 - Edit the Kubernetes YAML - add annotation, verify, then discard temporary change

Goal: Practice vim edits: add a permanent annotation under metadata, verify it, then open the file again, make a temporary edit and discard it (no save). This demonstrates saving and discarding changes in vim.

### Steps (inside the VM terminal / in the ~/Lab5 directory)

1. Open the manifest with vim:

```bash
cd ~/Lab5
vim k8s-sample.yaml
```

- When vim opens, ensure you are in command mode (press `Esc`) then press `i` to enter insert mode.

2. Add the annotation under the metadata section (indentation must match YAML). Example (insert these lines under metadata:):

```yaml
annotations:
  lab: lesson11
```

- After adding the lines, press `Esc` to return to command mode and save & quit:

```text
:wq
```

- Save a screenshot showing the saved file contents (using `cat`) as: `task10_verify_annotation.png`

Example verify command:

```bash
cat k8s-sample.yaml
```

3. Discard changes (practice: make a temporary edit and exit without saving)

- Open the file again:

```bash
vim k8s-sample.yaml
```

- Enter insert mode (`i`) and add a temporary comment line anywhere, for example:

```yaml
# temp: do-not-keep
```

- Do NOT save. Press `Esc` to go back to command mode, then force quit without saving:

```text
:q!
```

- Verify the file does NOT contain the temporary comment:

```bash
cat k8s-sample.yaml
```

- Save a screenshot of the `cat` output proving the temporary comment is not present as: `task10_verify_no_temp_comment.png`

📸 Screenshot Required:
- `task10_verify_annotation.png`  
- `task10_verify_no_temp_comment.png`

Notes:
- Make sure indentation and YAML formatting are correct when adding the annotation.
- If you perform these steps in a GUI terminal inside XFCE, include the GUI terminal screenshots.

## Task 11 - Vim editing practice - delete, undo, numeric deletes, navigation

Goal: Practice common vim commands: delete a single line with `dd`, undo with `u`, delete multiple lines with a numeric prefix, undo again, and practice basic navigation commands (`1G`, `G`, `$`, `0`). Capture verification screenshots showing the file before/after where appropriate.

> NOTE: Perform these steps in the ~/Lab5 directory on the previously created `k8s-sample.yaml`.

### Steps (inside the VM terminal / in the ~/Lab5 directory)

1. Open the file with vim:

```bash
cd ~/Lab5
vim k8s-sample.yaml
```

2. Delete the line containing `image: nginx:1.19` with a single command:

- Ensure you are in command mode (press `Esc`), move the cursor to the line with `image: nginx:1.19`, then delete that line with:

```text
dd
```

- Immediately undo the deletion with:

```text
u
```

- Capture a screenshot showing the file after the undo (or a `cat` output after saving) as: `task11_dd_delete_and_undo.png`

3. Delete 3 lines at once using the numeric delete command:

- In command mode, position the cursor on the first line of the three you want to delete (for example start at the `image:` line again), then run:

```text
d3d
```

(or `3dd` — either numeric prefix form is acceptable; document which you used)

- Immediately undo the deletion with:

```text
u
```

- Capture a screenshot showing the file after the undo (or a `cat` output) as: `task11_delete3_and_undo.png`

4. Navigation practice (from command mode)

- Jump to the first line:

```text
1G
```

- Note the line contents (capture a screenshot or `sed -n '1p' k8s-sample.yaml` output) saved as: `task11_line1.png`

- Jump to the last line:

```text
G
```

- On the line containing `containerPort: 80` press `$` to move to end of line, then `0` to move back to the start of the line. Capture a brief terminal screenshot showing you on the line and the commands (or capture `sed -n '$p' k8s-sample.yaml` and the shell prompt commands) as: `task11_navigation.png`

5. Exit vim (no changes should remain if you undid properly):

```text
:q
```

📸 Screenshot Required:
- `task11_dd_delete_and_undo.png`  
- `task11_delete3_and_undo.png`  
- `task11_line1.png`  
- `task11_navigation.png`

Notes:
- You may perform the deletion/undo steps either visually inside vim and capture GUI terminal screenshots, or perform the edits and save then use `cat` to demonstrate the file state — ensure screenshots clearly show the before/after or the undo effect.
- If you accidentally saved unwanted changes, restore the file to the correct contents (re-edit and save) before taking verification screenshots.

## Task 12 - Vim search, add matches, substitute, undo

Goal: Practice searching in vim with `/`, navigate matches with `n` and `N`, add additional matches, substitute across the file, undo, and exit without saving. Capture screenshots to show each verification step.

> NOTE: Perform these steps in the ~/Lab5 directory on the previously created `k8s-sample.yaml`.

### Steps (inside the VM terminal / in the ~/Lab5 directory)

1. Open the file with vim:

```bash
cd ~/Lab5
vim k8s-sample.yaml
```

2. Search for the string `nginx` using the forward search command:

- From command mode type:

```text
/nginx
```

and press Enter.

- Note the first match is highlighted and the cursor is placed on it. Save a screenshot showing the first match in vim as: `task12_search_nginx.png`

3. Move to the next match and previous match:

- Press `n` to jump to the next match (capture screenshot if desired) and press `N` to jump back to the previous match. Save a screenshot showing navigation between matches as: `task12_n_and_N_navigation.png`

4. Add two more occurrences of the word `nginx` in the file:

- Enter insert mode (`i`) at an appropriate place (for example add two new comment lines or add them under metadata as comments), type two new occurrences of `nginx`, then press `Esc` to return to command mode and save the file with `:w`.
- Save a screenshot showing the added occurrences (or `cat` output) as: `task12_added_occurrences.png`

5. Demonstrate that `n` cycles forward through all matches:

- In vim command mode press `/nginx` Enter, then repeatedly press `n` to cycle forward through each match. Capture a short sequence (or a terminal screenshot showing the cursor on a later match) as: `task12_cycle_matches.png`

6. Substitute all occurrences of `nginx` with `webapp`:

- From command mode execute the substitute command:

```text
:%s/nginx/webapp
```

- This will replace all occurrences in the file (note: this changes the buffer). Save a screenshot showing the substitution result (or `cat k8s-sample.yaml`) as: `task12_substitute_result.png`

7. Immediately undo the substitution using `u`:

- Press `u` in command mode to undo the last change. Save a screenshot showing the file restored to the previous state as: `task12_undo_and_quit.png`

8. Quit vim without saving any accidental changes (if you didn't already save after substitution and want to discard):

- If you want to ensure no changes were written, exit with:

```text
:q!
```

- If you intentionally saved the substitution and then undid it and wish to quit normally, use `:q`.

📸 Screenshot Required:
- `task12_search_nginx.png`  
- `task12_n_and_N_navigation.png`  
- `task12_added_occurrences.png`  
- `task12_cycle_matches.png`  
- `task12_substitute_result.png`  
- `task12_undo_and_quit.png`

Notes:
- If you perform the edits in a GUI terminal inside XFCE, include GUI terminal screenshots.
- If you accidentally left the substitution saved and want to revert to the original file, re-open and restore the content as needed.

## Task 13 - Exam Evaluation Question

Goal: This is an exam-style evaluation prompt. Students are asked to install Docker Desktop as part of the evaluation exercise. No commands, solutions, hints, or step-by-step instructions are provided here — install Docker Desktop using your own knowledge and research.

Instructions for students:
- Install Docker Desktop on your workstation or VM. No commands or solutions are provided in this lab — treat this as an evaluation/exam question.
- Verify Docker Desktop is installed by launching the Docker Desktop application and confirming it runs.
- Capture a screenshot of Docker Desktop running (or other clear evidence that Docker Desktop is installed and started) and save it as: `task13_docker_desktop.png`

Notes:
- This task intentionally provides no commands, package names, or step-by-step instructions. You must research and determine the correct installation steps for your OS/environment.
- If your VM environment does not support Docker Desktop (e.g., limited virtualization), document the limitation with a screenshot and a one-line caption in your submission explaining why you could not install Docker Desktop.

📸 Screenshot Required:
- `task13_docker_desktop.png` (or a screenshot showing why installation could not be completed)

---

## Troubleshooting & notes
- If add-apt-repository is missing when adding a PPA, install software-properties-common:
  - `sudo apt install software-properties-common -y` (capture screenshot as `task8_install_software_properties.png`)
- If any apt commands fail due to networking, capture the error output as screenshots and include them in your submission.
- When working with vim, remember `i` to enter insert mode, `Esc` to return to command mode, `:wq` to save and quit, and `:q!` to quit without saving. For undo use `u`, for redo use `Ctrl-R`, and numeric deletes can be `3dd` or `d3d`. For search use `/pattern`, navigate with `n` and `N`, and substitute with `:%s/pattern/replacement`.
